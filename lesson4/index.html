    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Lesson 4 gave me a deeper look into the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript, and also reminded me how much I still have to learn about working with JavaScript in general. 
      I was able to follow along with the examples in CodePen and even figured out how to get the code running there, which gave me some confidence. But when I tried moving 
      the code into separate HTML, CSS, and JS files, I hit a wall. The page just wouldn’t load, and I wasn’t sure what I had done wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some digging, I realized the issue wasn’t actually my code but the way browsers handle ES modules. I had assumed I could just open the HTML file directly from 
      File Explorer, but modern JavaScript requires running a local server for it to work properly. Once I tried Python’s built-in server, everything displayed fine. That 
      was both frustrating and encouraging—frustrating because it wasn’t obvious, but encouraging because it showed me the code I had written was okay all along.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another challenge was making sense of the different syntax styles. Some Esri samples still use the older <code>require()</code> approach, while others use ES modules 
      with <code>await</code>. For someone new to JavaScript, that inconsistency is pretty confusing. Still, it pushed me to slow down, look more carefully at the 
      documentation, and begin to understand how asynchronous functions and modules actually work.

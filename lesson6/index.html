        Lesson 6 provided a comprehensive introduction to layer visualization in the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript, covering symbol 
        classes for 2D and 3D representations, different renderer types, visual variables, and popup configurations. Working with 3D 
        symbols and the ExtrudeSymbol3DLayer was particularly interesting, as the ability to represent data through both color and height 
        added a powerful dimension to the visualization. In my Florida county health rankings map, I used visual variables to show adult 
        obesity rates through color and unemployment rates through extrusion height, allowing me to communicate two variables simultaneously.

        The 3D viewpoint determination tool was a game-changer. In previous lessons, setting up the camera position involved considerable 
        trial and error. Having a tool that lets you navigate to the desired view and simply copy the camera properties saved significant 
        time and frustration.

        Configuring popups was more straightforward than expected, though I initially wasn't sure where certain properties should be set. 
        I learned that the PopupTemplate defines content and structure, while the view's popup properties control behavior like docking and 
        positioning. Understanding this separation helped me organize my code better. One area I found somewhat confusing was the distinction 
        between different renderer types and when to use each one. I used a SimpleRenderer with visual variables for this project, but I'd 
        like to explore other renderer types more to fully understand their use cases.

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        I built a simple hurricane viewer that asks for a year and draws IBTrACS track lines for that period. The map uses the
        <strong>dark-gray-vector</strong> basemap and a single FeatureLayer for the tracks. I filter the layer with a
        <strong>definitionExpression</strong> on the <strong>year</strong> field so only that year’s features appear. Tracks are shown as
        dotted lines whose width and color change with Saffir–Simpson categories via a <strong>ClassBreaksRenderer</strong> on
        <strong>USA_WIND</strong>. I went with a yellow‑orange‑red palette and progressively thicker strokes so the strongest segments
        stand out without overwhelming the basemap.
      </p>
      <p>
        Popups include storm name, year, maximum wind speed, basin, nature, and date using a fields‑based
        <strong>PopupTemplate</strong>. After the layer loads, I run a quick <strong>Query</strong> with the same year filter to confirm that data
        actually exists. If nothing comes back (or the request fails), the app nudges the user rather than leaving an empty map. The
        flow is pretty straightforward: import modules with <strong>$arcgis.import</strong>, make the map and view, define the
        renderer, add the layer with its popup and filter, and finally validate the results.
      </p>
      <p>
        The trickiest parts were picking class breaks and stroke widths that read well at different zoom levels and user input error handling.
        Validating the year and using numeric comparisons in the <strong>definitionExpression</strong> helped avoid odd cases. I
        also tweaked the dotted <strong>SimpleLineSymbol</strong> so categories feel distinct but not noisy. I came away more comfortable with
        <strong>ClassBreaksRenderer</strong>, <strong>FeatureLayer</strong> filtering, <strong>Query</strong> patterns, and <strong>PopupTemplate</strong>
        fieldInfos. My main references were the Esri docs, API sandbox samples, and ColorBrewer for symbology.

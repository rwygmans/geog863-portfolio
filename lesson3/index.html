    <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>The poverty rate is an economic indicator that measures the percentage of people with income below the poverty threshold. 
        Federal and state governments use these estimates in funding formulas to allocate funds to local communities. 
        Local communities often use these estimates to identify the number of individuals or families eligible for various programs.</p>
      <p>This report uses data from the 2000 to 2012 American Community Surveys (ACS) to examine trends in poverty rates for the 
        nation, states, and the District of Columbia<sup>1</sup>. The report also analyzes the distribution of people by income-to-poverty 
        ratios for the nation, states, and the District of Columbia over this period. In addition, this report discusses the 
        current poverty rates for metropolitan statistical areas with large populations.</p>
    <h3>Highlights</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>For the first time since 2007&ndash;2008, the ACS poverty rate for the nation did not change between 2011 and 2012.<sup>2</sup></li>
      <li>The number and percentage of people in poverty did not change in 43 states and the District of Columbia between 2011 and 
        2012.</li>
      <li>Nationally, between 2000 and 2012, the percentage of people in poverty increased from 12.2 percent to 15.9 percent, 
        while the number of people in poverty increased from 33.3 million to 48.8 million.</li>
      <li>Both the number and percentage of people in poverty increased in 44 states between 2000 and 2012.</li>
      <li>The percentage of people in the United States with income below 50 percent of the poverty thresholds grew from 5.0 
        percent in 2000 to 7.0 percent in 2012. Over this period, the percentage of people with income below 125 percent of the 
        poverty thresholds grew from 16.5 percent to 20.8 percent.</li>
      <li>Among the largest 25 metropolitan areas, poverty rates in 2012 ranged from 8.4 percent to 19.0 percent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The estimates contained in this report are based on the 2000 to 2012 ACS. Since 2005, the ACS has been con- ducted every month 
      with income data collected for the 12 months preceding the interview. Since the survey is continuous, adjacent ACS years have 
      some income reference months in common. Therefore, comparing the 2011 ACS with the 2012 ACS is not an exact com- parison of 
      the economic conditions in 2011 with those in 2012 and comparisons should be interpreted with care.<sup>3</sup> For more information on 
      the ACS sample design and other topics, visit <a href="https://www.census.gov/acs/www" rel="nofollow">www.census.gov/acs/www</a>.</p>

        <li><sup>1</sup> The data for 2000 were obtained from the Census 2000 Supplementary Survey (C2SS), which was the demonstration 
          stage of the ACS. The C2SS was designed to provide accurate estimates for housing units and the population for the 50 states 
          and the District of Columbia based on a sample of approximately 890,000 housing units. This sample did not include people in 
          group quarters. In this report, the C2SS is referred as the 2000 ACS. For more information on the accuracy of the data see

        <li><sup>2</sup> Following the standard specified by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in Statistical Policy Directive 
          14, data from the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC) are used to estimate the official 
          national poverty rate. For more information, see notes at the end of this report.</li>

      <h3>Poverty 2011 to 2012</h3>
      <p>Table 1 shows the number and percentage of people in poverty for the United States and Puerto Rico for 2011 and 2012. 
        In 2012, about 48.8 million people or 15.9 percent of the U.S. population had income below their respective poverty level. 
        After four consecutive years of increases, the number and the percentage of people with income below the poverty level did 
        not change between 2011 and 2012. 
      </p>
      <p>
        During this period, poverty rates did not change for 45 states and the District of Columbia. In three states (California,
         Mississippi, and New Hampshire), both the number and the percentage of people in poverty increased. In New Jersey and Wyoming, the number of people 
        in poverty increased. In Minnesota and Texas, the percentage of people in poverty declined.
      </p>
      <p>Figure 1 displays the range of poverty rates across the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico using the 2012 
        ACS and the Puerto Rico Community Survey. The estimated 2012 poverty rates ranged from a low of 10.0 percent for New Hampshire
         to a high of 24.2 percent for Mississippi.<sup>4</sup> Among the states, poverty rates were the lowest in New Hampshire 
         (10.0 percent), Alaska (10.1 percent), Maryland (10.3 percent), Connecticut (10.7 percent), and New Jersey (10.8 percent), 
         while the rate for Mississippi (24.2 percent) was the highest, followed by the rate for New Mexico (20.8 percent). 
      </p>
      <p>
         For Puerto Rico, the number of people with income below poverty level declined from 1.67 million in 2011 to 1.63 million in 
         2012. The change in the percentage of people in poverty was not statistically significant.
      </p>

      <h3>Poverty 2000 to 2012</h3>
      <p>According to the 2000 ACS, about 33.3 million people or 12.2 percent of the U.S. population had income below their respective 
        poverty level. In 2012, the number of people in poverty increased to about 48.8 million people or 15.9 percent.</p>

          <li><sup>4</sup> The poverty rates for New Hampshire, Alaska, Maryland, and Connecticut were not statistically different

        <li>Poverty status is determined for individuals in housing units and noninstitutional group quarters. The poverty universe excludes children under age 15 who are not related to the householder, people living in institutional group quarters, and people living in college dormitories or military barracks.</li>
        <li>Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. A margin of error is a measure of an estimate&rsquo;s variability. The larger the margin of error in relation to the size of the estimate, the less reliable the estimate. This number when added to or subtracted from the estimate forms the 90 percent confidence interval.</li>
      </ol>
